### Benefits of Amazon CloudFront

#### Low Latency and High Performance

CloudFront uses a global network of edge locations to cache and serve content close to users, reducing latency. For example, static assets like CSS, JS, or images for a web application are served from the nearest location, leading to noticeably faster page loads across regions.

#### Secure Content Delivery

CloudFront integrates seamlessly with AWS Shield and WAF for DDoS protection and request filtering. It supports HTTPS encryption, signed URLs, and georestriction, ensuring that content is delivered securely and only to intended audiences. This is particularly useful for delivering protected media streams or private APIs.

### Use Cases

#### Website Acceleration

Static websites hosted on S3 or dynamic web applications hosted on EC2 or containers can use CloudFront to cache and deliver their content globally. Regardless of the user's geographic location, content is served from the nearest edge location, drastically improving page load speed and user experience.

#### API and Software Distribution

For RESTful APIs or downloadable software (e.g., installers, game assets, patches), CloudFront reduces latency and offloads origin servers by caching responses and files at edge locations. This enhances the performance and scalability of services with a global client base.

### Best Practices

Use origin groups with failover to enhance reliability.  
Enable compression and cache policies for performance tuning.  
Integrate WAF to block malicious requests.  
Monitor with CloudWatch metrics and real-time logs.

CloudFront is essential for building modern, performant, and secure web architectures. Whether you're delivering a simple static site or streaming high-resolution video globally, CloudFront ensures your content is fast, secure, and always available close to your users.
