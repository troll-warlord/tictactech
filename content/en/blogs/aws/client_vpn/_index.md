**AWS Client VPN** is a managed, scalable VPN service that enables secure, remote access to **AWS resources** and **on-premises networks** using **OpenVPN**-based clients. It eliminates the need for self-managed VPN servers.

### Benefits of Client VPN

#### Scalable Remote Access

Easily scale to hundreds or thousands of remote users without worrying about infrastructure capacity or maintenance.

#### Fully Managed

AWS handles availability, software patching, and infrastructure redundancy â€” reducing operational overhead.

#### Fine-Grained Access Control

Integrate with **Active Directory**, **IAM**, or **mutual authentication** using client certificates for user-level access control.

#### Secure and Private

Traffic is encrypted in transit, and split tunneling can be configured to route only AWS traffic through the VPN.

---

### Use Cases

- Secure developer access to private VPC workloads.
- Allow remote employees to access AWS-hosted applications.
- Extend internal tooling or dashboards to authorized partners.

---

### Best Practices

- Enable **split tunneling** to reduce VPN traffic load when internet access is not needed.
- Use **Security Groups** and **Authorization Rules** to control access per user/group.
- Rotate **client certificates** and enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** where possible.
- Monitor sessions with **CloudWatch metrics** and **VPC Flow Logs**.

AWS Client VPN simplifies secure remote access for users while offloading operational complexity. Ideal for distributed teams and hybrid access scenarios.
