{{< service-header >}}

**AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** automatically manage and scale a fleet of **EC2 instances** based on defined policies, demand, and health checks â€” ensuring **availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **cost optimization**.

### Topics

### Benefits of ASG

#### Dynamic Scalability

Scale instances **horizontally** based on metrics like CPU, memory, request count, or even custom CloudWatch metrics.

#### High Availability

Distribute instances across **multiple Availability Zones** for fault tolerance and reliability.

#### Health Monitoring & Replacement

Automatically replaces unhealthy instances to maintain the desired state and application uptime.

#### Cost Efficiency

Integrate with **EC2 Spot**, **Savings Plans**, and **Instance Refresh** to optimize costs while maintaining performance.

### Use Cases

- Web and API backends that need to scale up during traffic spikes.
- Background processing systems needing on-demand compute.
- Managed fleets of EC2 for containerized workloads (e.g., ECS, self-managed Kubernetes).

---

### Best Practices

- Use **launch templates** over launch configurations.
- Define **scaling policies** for both CPU thresholds and scheduled scale events.
- Enable **instance warm-up** to prevent premature scaling decisions.
- Integrate with **Elastic Load Balancers** (ALB/NLB) for traffic distribution.

ASGs are fundamental to building elastic, fault-tolerant, and self-healing infrastructure on AWS. Scale smart, scale reliably.
