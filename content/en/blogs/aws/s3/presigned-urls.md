## Pre-signed URLs

Pre-signed URLs grant temporary access to S3 objects without making them publicly accessible.

### Use Cases

- **Secure File Sharing**: Share access to private files securely.
- **Time-limited Uploads/Downloads**: Limit access to specific time windows.
- **API Integrations**: Allow clients to upload files directly without exposing credentials.

Pre-signed URLs respect bucket permissions and expiry duration set during generation.
