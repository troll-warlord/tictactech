{{< service-header >}}

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2. Unlike object storage solutions like S3, EBS provides low-latency, persistent block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances, making it ideal for databases, transactional workloads, and applications that require consistent and fast disk performance.

Each EBS volume behaves like a raw, unformatted block device and supports features such as snapshots, encryption, and performance tuning. It is tightly integrated with the AWS ecosystem, offering high availability and durability within a single Availability Zone.

### Benefits of Amazon EBS

#### Persistent Block Storage

EBS volumes provide durable block-level storage that remains available even if the associated EC2 instance stops or is terminated. For example, an application server storing its logs and runtime state can reboot without losing disk data if it's using EBS.

#### Fine-Tuned Performance

EBS allows you to choose from different volume types—like gp3, io2, and st1—each optimized for specific workloads. A production-grade relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL can benefit from io2 volumes for IOPS-intensive operations, while a log processing server might use st1 for cost-effective throughput.

#### Easy Backups and Snapshots

You can take point-in-time backups (snapshots) of your volumes and store them in Amazon S3, enabling disaster recovery and migration across regions. Snapshots can be used to quickly clone environments or recreate a volume at a specific point in time.

#### Secure and Encrypted

Amazon EBS supports encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS. You can easily ensure that data stored on your volumes is encrypted without managing any encryption keys or software.

### Use Cases

#### Running Databases on EC2

EBS volumes are ideal for database workloads running on EC2. You can run MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, or MongoDB directly on an EC2 instance with an attached io2 volume for high IOPS and low latency. The persistence of EBS ensures data durability across instance restarts.

#### Application Servers and Caching Layers

Web servers or caching layers often need high-throughput access to temporary or session data. EBS gp3 volumes provide a balance of performance and cost, ideal for applications that need consistent disk speed without provisioning dedicated hardware.

#### Snapshot-Based Dev/Test Cloning

Many teams use snapshots to create clones of production environments for testing and development. Developers can spin up identical environments with attached volumes created from production snapshots—reducing risk and accelerating iteration.

### Best Practices

- Choose the right volume type for your workload—use io2 for high-performance databases, gp3 for general-purpose, and sc1/st1 for cold or throughput-heavy data.
- Always enable **EBS-optimized instances** to ensure dedicated throughput between EC2 and EBS.
- Regularly create **snapshots** for backup and disaster recovery.
- Use **Elastic Volumes** to dynamically increase volume size or switch types without downtime.
- Enable **encryption** for security compliance and data protection.

Amazon EBS powers mission-critical workloads across industries, offering the durability, flexibility, and performance required by modern applications. Whether you're hosting a database, scaling a web tier, or building fault-tolerant systems, EBS is a foundational service for persistent, block-level storage in the cloud.
