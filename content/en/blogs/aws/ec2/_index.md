{{< service-header >}}

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a foundational AWS service that provides scalable virtual servers (instances) in the cloud. It allows you to launch compute resources on-demand, with complete control over operating system, instance type, networking, and storage configurations.

With EC2, you can build flexible, resizable, and secure compute infrastructure without investing in physical hardware. Whether you're deploying a single web server or a fleet of services across multiple regions, EC2 adapts to your scaling and performance needs.

### Benefits of Amazon EC2

#### On-Demand Elasticity

You can launch or terminate EC2 instances in minutes, making it ideal for dynamic scaling. For example, you can automatically increase capacity during peak traffic hours using Auto Scaling and reduce cost during idle periods.

#### Variety of Instance Types

EC2 offers a broad selection of instance types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or GPU workloads. Choose t4g or t3 instances for low-cost web servers, r6a for memory-intensive applications, or p5 for ML training workloads.

#### Integration with Other AWS Services

EC2 integrates natively with services like ELB, IAM, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, and VPC. You can place your instances in private subnets, attach IAM roles for secure access, and stream logs to CloudWatch for observability.

#### Customization and Control

You can choose your own AMIs (Amazon Machine Images), configure EBS volumes, attach Elastic IPs, and run startup scripts via user data. This is especially useful for building repeatable environments or immutable infrastructure.

#### Secure by Design

With security groups, NACLs, and IAM roles, EC2 provides deep controls for access, encryption, and compliance. You can run sensitive workloads in isolated subnets with no internet exposure.

### Use Cases

#### Hosting Web and API Servers

EC2 is commonly used for deploying web servers or backend APIs. For example, a Python FastAPI application can run on a t3.micro instance behind a load balancer with EBS for persistent storage and auto-scaling enabled for high availability.

#### High-Performance Computing (HPC)

EC2â€™s compute-optimized or GPU-powered instances can be used for simulations, rendering, or ML training. You can use c7gn or p5 instances for workloads requiring low latency and high throughput.

#### Dev/Test Environments

You can create and destroy EC2 instances programmatically or via CI/CD to spin up environments for development, testing, or staging. This is cost-effective compared to maintaining permanent infrastructure.

#### Self-Hosted Databases and Tools

If you want full control over database engines like PostgreSQL or self-hosted tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, or Vault, EC2 provides the flexibility to run and secure them as you prefer.

### Best Practices

- **Use Auto Scaling** to match capacity with demand.
- **Choose the right instance family** based on your CPU, memory, storage, and network needs.
- **Use Spot Instances** for non-critical or batch workloads to save cost.
- Enable **termination protection** for critical instances.
- Use **IAM roles** instead of storing credentials on instances.
- Regularly **patch your AMIs** and use **AWS Systems Manager** for automation.
