{{< service-header >}}

A **Deployment** in Kubernetes manages stateless applications by declaratively maintaining the desired number of pod replicas and orchestrating rolling updates. It abstracts away manual pod management and provides robust mechanisms for scaling, rollback, and version control of application workloads.

Deployments are the most commonly used controller in Kubernetes for running web services, APIs, and microservices.

### Benefits of Deployment

#### Declarative and Reproducible

Deployments define the desired state of an application — including image versions, replica counts, labels, and update strategies — in a YAML manifest. Kubernetes ensures the actual cluster state matches the desired state, offering a clean GitOps-compatible way to manage workloads.

#### Rolling Updates and Rollbacks

Kubernetes automatically performs rolling updates, gradually replacing old pods with new ones while maintaining availability. If something goes wrong, a rollback can be triggered to return to a previous working version.

This allows safe and gradual upgrades with minimal downtime.

#### Easy Scaling and Lifecycle Management

Scaling a deployment is as simple as changing the `replicas` count. Kubernetes handles the orchestration, scheduling, and health checks automatically. You can also pause/resume updates or trigger restarts programmatically or through `kubectl`.

### Use Cases

#### Running Web Applications and APIs

Stateless workloads like frontend services, backend APIs, or web servers are typically run as Deployments. Kubernetes maintains the desired number of healthy replicas and handles scheduling, restarts, and load balancing.

#### Blue/Green or Canary Releases

Using labels, annotations, and multiple deployments, teams can implement blue/green or canary deployments to reduce risk during rollout. This enables better control over which users see which version of an application.

#### Self-Healing Application Patterns

When a pod crashes or becomes unhealthy, the Deployment controller automatically replaces it. This ensures continuous availability and simplifies operational management.

### Best Practices

Use readiness and liveness probes to manage pod health and avoid premature traffic routing.  
Pin to immutable image tags or digests to prevent unexpected image changes.  
Enable resource requests/limits to prevent noisy neighbor problems.  
Avoid long-lived ephemeral containers — scale via replicas instead.  
Monitor rollout progress using `kubectl rollout status` or via automation pipelines.

Deployments are the backbone of stateless application management in Kubernetes. They enable scalable, reliable, and repeatable delivery of containerized workloads — making them ideal for everything from microservices to monolithic web apps.
