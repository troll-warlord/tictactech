{{< service-header >}}

A **Kubernetes Namespace** is a way to **logically isolate resources** in a single cluster. It’s like a virtual sub-cluster within the main cluster, allowing teams, applications, or environments to operate independently — but still share the underlying infrastructure.

### Benefits of Namespaces

#### Resource Isolation

Separate teams or workloads can have their own space, reducing the risk of accidental interference. Dev, test, and prod environments can all coexist without stepping on each other’s toes.

#### Access Control via RBAC

Namespaces work hand-in-hand with **RoleBindings** and **ClusterRoles**. You can scope permissions to a specific namespace, ensuring the principle of least privilege.

#### Quota Enforcement

Namespaces allow administrators to apply **resource quotas** and **limits**, controlling how much CPU, memory, and objects (pods, PVCs, etc.) can be created.

#### Clean Organization

Namespaced resources (like pods, services, and deployments) are logically grouped, making them easier to manage, monitor, and delete.

---

### Use Cases

- Separating Dev/Test/Prod environments within a single cluster
- Multi-team or multi-project Kubernetes deployments
- Scoped access for CI/CD pipelines
- Logical grouping of related applications and workloads

---

### Best Practices

- Use meaningful namespace names like `payments-dev`, `search-prod`, etc.
- Apply `LimitRange` and `ResourceQuota` to prevent resource hogging.
- Clean up unused namespaces to reduce clutter.
- Avoid putting everything in the `default` namespace.
- Use `kubens` and `kubectx` tools for easy namespace switching.

Namespaces provide a powerful layer of **logical separation** in Kubernetes. When used properly, they enhance security, organization, and governance across teams and workloads.
