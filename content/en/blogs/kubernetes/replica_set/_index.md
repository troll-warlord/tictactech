{{< service-header >}}

A **ReplicaSet** ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are **running at all times** in a Kubernetes cluster. If a pod crashes or is deleted, the ReplicaSet brings up a replacement.

It is the **underlying controller used by Deployments** to maintain pod availability.

### Benefits of ReplicaSet

#### High Availability

Maintains the desired replica count automatically, ensuring uptime even if nodes fail.

#### Self-Healing

Automatically creates replacement pods if any are deleted or crash unexpectedly.

#### Label-Based Selection

Pods are matched using **label selectors**, offering fine-grained control over which pods belong to which ReplicaSet.

---

### Use Cases

- Keeping 3 replicas of your frontend pods alive
- Managing pods without the extra abstraction of a Deployment
- Blue/green or canary testing (advanced scenarios)

---

### Best Practices

- Prefer using **Deployments** for most use cases — they offer rollback and versioning over ReplicaSets.
- Label your pods carefully for predictable behavior.
- Don’t create ReplicaSets manually unless you have a specific need.
- Avoid overlapping label selectors — it causes unpredictable behavior.

ReplicaSets form the **backbone of automated scaling and recovery** in Kubernetes — but you rarely need to interact with them directly.
