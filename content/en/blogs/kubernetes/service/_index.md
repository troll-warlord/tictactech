{{< service-header >}}

A **Service** in Kubernetes provides a stable network endpoint to expose a group of pods. It enables reliable communication between components inside the cluster (ClusterIP), external access (NodePort, LoadBalancer), or custom routing (via Ingress).

### Benefits of Kubernetes Services

#### Service Discovery

Pods get dynamic IPs, but a Service provides a consistent DNS name for communication. Kubernetes handles automatic registration and load balancing for backing pods.

#### Flexible Exposure

Expose services internally with `ClusterIP`, to the nodeâ€™s IP with `NodePort`, or externally via cloud-managed `LoadBalancer` or `Ingress`.

---

### Use Cases

#### Backend APIs

Expose stateless app backends or microservices internally using `ClusterIP`.

#### External Applications

Expose a frontend service (e.g., web UI) using `LoadBalancer` for global internet access.

### Best Practices

Label pods correctly for accurate selector matching.  
Use `readinessProbes` to ensure only healthy pods get traffic.  
Use `headless` services for direct pod-to-pod access in stateful apps.  
Prefer `Ingress` for complex routing over multiple services.

Kubernetes Services form the backbone of in-cluster and external connectivity. With simple configuration, they abstract pod lifecycles and simplify networking for distributed apps.
