An **Azure Subscription** is the **billing unit** and **access boundary** within Azure. It links your usage of Azure services to an account, controls who can manage what, and determines how resources are billed and tracked.

### Benefits of Subscriptions

#### Billing Separation

Track and manage costs independently across projects, teams, or clients.

#### Access Isolation

Control who can access what via **RBAC** at the subscription level, and use **Management Groups** to roll up governance.

#### Quotas and Limits

Each subscription has its own **resource quotas**, allowing better scaling and segmentation of workloads.

---

### Use Cases

- Set up **separate subscriptions** for prod vs dev environments.
- Create dedicated subscriptions for **client-facing solutions** or **multi-tenant applications**.
- Use **Enterprise Agreements (EA)** or **MSPs** to manage multiple subscriptions centrally.

---

### Best Practices

- Use **Management Groups** to apply policies across multiple subscriptions.
- Tag all subscriptions with **owner**, **purpose**, and **contact** metadata.
- Monitor **subscription-level quotas** and set budget alerts to avoid surprises.

Azure Subscriptions provide a foundational layer for organizing, securing, and billing your cloud resources at scale.
