**Azure Resource Group** is a **logical container** that holds related Azure resources like VMs, networks, databases, and more. It serves as the **unit of deployment, access control, and lifecycle management** in Azure.

### Benefits of Resource Groups

#### Simplified Management

Manage, deploy, and monitor all related resources as a single unit. Changes or deletions apply collectively.

#### Access Control & Tagging

Use **RBAC** to define permissions at the group level and apply **tags** for cost tracking and automation.

#### Deployment Scope

Templates (ARM/Bicep/Terraform/Pulumi) typically target a resource group, ensuring modular and scoped deployments.

---

### Use Cases

- Group resources by **application**, **environment** (dev/test/prod), or **department**.
- Apply **auto-shutdown**, **monitoring**, or **cost alerts** to grouped resources.
- Cleanup or decommission entire projects by deleting a single resource group.

---

### Best Practices

- Use consistent **naming conventions** tied to project and environment.
- Separate **critical workloads** into different groups for isolation.
- Enable **locks** on production resource groups to avoid accidental deletion.

Azure Resource Groups are fundamental to organizing, securing, and automating your cloud infrastructure in a manageable and efficient way.
