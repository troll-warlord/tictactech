### Benefits of Azure DNS Zone

#### High Availability and Performance

Azure DNS is backed by a **highly available, global network**, ensuring low-latency name resolution for users anywhere in the world.

#### Integrated with Azure Resource Manager

Manage DNS zones and records just like any other Azure resource using **ARM templates**, **Azure CLI**, **PowerShell**, or the **Portal**.

#### Secure and Auditable

Supports **RBAC** and **activity logs**, so DNS changes are secure and traceable — useful in enterprise and compliance-sensitive environments.

---

### Use Cases

#### Hosting Public DNS Zones

Host authoritative DNS zones for your domains (e.g., `example.com`) and create records like A, CNAME, MX, TXT for your applications and services.

#### Internal DNS Resolution

Use **Private DNS Zones** with Azure Virtual Network for name resolution of internal services (e.g., `api.internal.contoso.local`) without requiring public exposure.

#### Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Scenarios

Combine private and public zones to build hybrid DNS architectures where on-prem and cloud workloads can resolve internal names seamlessly.

---

### Best Practices

- Use **Private DNS Zones** for internal services and link them to Virtual Networks.
- Enable **Zone Delegation** for managing subdomains independently.
- Implement **RBAC** to control who can modify DNS records.
- Use **alias records** for Azure services like Load Balancer and Public IPs to maintain dynamic mappings.

Azure DNS Zone provides a fast, reliable, and secure DNS hosting service that integrates natively with your Azure resources and networking components.
