{{< service-header >}}

**Azure Virtual Network (VNet)** is the foundational building block of networking in Azure. It provides **logical network isolation**, enabling you to securely run virtual machines, containers, and applications while maintaining complete control over IP addressing, DNS, routing, and network security.

VNets are analogous to traditional **on-premises networks**, but with the added scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration that Azure provides.

### Benefits of Azure VNet

#### Secure Network Isolation

Every VNet is **logically isolated** from others, giving you complete control over your network environment. You define **custom IP address ranges**, segment with **subnets**, and apply **network security groups (NSGs)** to manage traffic flow.

#### Fine-Grained Traffic Control

You can enforce **inbound and outbound rules** at both subnet and NIC level using NSGs. Route tables allow custom traffic paths (e.g., to appliances or firewalls), and **service endpoints** or **private endpoints** let you securely connect to Azure services without internet exposure.

#### Peering for Cross-VNet Communication

VNet peering enables **low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity** between VNets — even across regions. It's like extending your private network without using a gateway or public IPs.

#### Integration with On-Premises Networks

You can use **VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute** to connect VNets to your on-prem infrastructure securely, enabling hybrid cloud setups where on-prem and cloud resources communicate seamlessly.

#### DNS and Name Resolution

VNets support custom DNS settings for internal name resolution. You can also integrate with Azure DNS Private Zones to maintain DNS control across complex setups.

### Use Cases

#### Hosting Multi-Tier Applications

Use subnets to separate web, application, and database layers. Apply NSGs to enforce least-privilege communication (e.g., only app subnet can reach the database).

#### Secure Access to Azure Services

Use **private endpoints** to connect securely to services like Azure Storage, SQL, and Key Vault — traffic never leaves Microsoft’s backbone network.

#### Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology

Use one VNet as the **hub** for shared services (e.g., firewalls, DNS, jump boxes), and connect **spoke VNets** for individual applications or departments using VNet peering.

#### Hybrid Networking

Use **VPN Gateway** to establish IPsec tunnels to on-premises networks, or **ExpressRoute** for high-performance, private connections with SLA guarantees.

### Best Practices

- Use **CIDR blocks that don’t overlap** with on-prem networks to simplify hybrid setups.
- Segment networks into **subnets by function**, not just size — this simplifies monitoring and policy enforcement.
- Use **NSGs** to apply least-privilege access rules. Monitor them regularly using **Azure Network Watcher**.
- Prefer **VNet Peering** over VPN for cross-region or intra-region connectivity unless regulatory requirements demand gateway separation.
- Tag VNets and subnets clearly to reflect their purpose, environment (dev/prod), or application.

Azure VNets are essential for designing secure, scalable, and structured network environments in the cloud. They provide the control and flexibility you need to architect everything from simple test environments to complex, enterprise-grade hybrid solutions.
