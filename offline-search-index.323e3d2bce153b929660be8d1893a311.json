[{"body":" Amazon VPC Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated network within AWS where you can launch resources in a fully controlled environment. It provides granular control over IP address ranges, subnets, routing, NAT, security groups, and more.\nVPC is the foundational networking layer in AWS, enabling secure and segmented architectures for a wide range of applications.\nTopics Benefits of Amazon VPC Custom Network Topology With VPC, you define your own IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways. This allows precise control — for example, creating isolated subnets for web, app, and database tiers with different security settings.\nSecurity and Access Control VPC integrates with security groups, NACLs, and IAM policies to enforce least-privilege access. For instance, you can restrict database subnets to accept traffic only from application subnets using security groups.\nUse Cases Multi-tier Application Architecture You can design multi-tier applications within a VPC by using public subnets for web servers and private subnets for databases. This separation enhances both security and scalability.\nHybrid Connectivity VPC supports VPN and Direct Connect to extend your on-premises network to AWS, enabling hybrid cloud scenarios such as DR, backups, or shared services.\nBest Practices Use multiple Availability Zones for high availability.\nIsolate workloads using subnet boundaries.\nTag resources for visibility and automation.\nEnable VPC Flow Logs to monitor traffic patterns.\nUse VPC endpoints for private access to AWS services.\nVPC is the backbone of secure AWS deployments. It empowers teams to build scalable, segmented, and secure architectures that align closely with traditional network designs — but with the power and flexibility of the cloud.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Amazon VPC Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/aws/virtual_private_cloud/","tags":["aws","vpc","networking","isolation"],"title":""},{"body":" Amazon EBS Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2. Unlike object storage solutions like S3, EBS provides low-latency, persistent block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances, making it ideal for databases, transactional workloads, and applications that require consistent and fast disk performance.\nEach EBS volume behaves like a raw, unformatted block device and supports features such as snapshots, encryption, and performance tuning. It is tightly integrated with the AWS ecosystem, offering high availability and durability within a single Availability Zone.\nTopics Benefits of Amazon EBS Persistent Block Storage EBS volumes provide durable block-level storage that remains available even if the associated EC2 instance stops or is terminated. For example, an application server storing its logs and runtime state can reboot without losing disk data if it’s using EBS.\nFine-Tuned Performance EBS allows you to choose from different volume types—like gp3, io2, and st1—each optimized for specific workloads. A production-grade relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL can benefit from io2 volumes for IOPS-intensive operations, while a log processing server might use st1 for cost-effective throughput.\nEasy Backups and Snapshots You can take point-in-time backups (snapshots) of your volumes and store them in Amazon S3, enabling disaster recovery and migration across regions. Snapshots can be used to quickly clone environments or recreate a volume at a specific point in time.\nSecure and Encrypted Amazon EBS supports encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS. You can easily ensure that data stored on your volumes is encrypted without managing any encryption keys or software.\nUse Cases Running Databases on EC2 EBS volumes are ideal for database workloads running on EC2. You can run MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, or MongoDB directly on an EC2 instance with an attached io2 volume for high IOPS and low latency. The persistence of EBS ensures data durability across instance restarts.\nApplication Servers and Caching Layers Web servers or caching layers often need high-throughput access to temporary or session data. EBS gp3 volumes provide a balance of performance and cost, ideal for applications that need consistent disk speed without provisioning dedicated hardware.\nSnapshot-Based Dev/Test Cloning Many teams use snapshots to create clones of production environments for testing and development. Developers can spin up identical environments with attached volumes created from production snapshots—reducing risk and accelerating iteration.\nBest Practices Choose the right volume type for your workload—use io2 for high-performance databases, gp3 for general-purpose, and sc1/st1 for cold or throughput-heavy data. Always enable EBS-optimized instances to ensure dedicated throughput between EC2 and EBS. Regularly create snapshots for backup and disaster recovery. Use Elastic Volumes to dynamically increase volume size or switch types without downtime. Enable encryption for security compliance and data protection. Amazon EBS powers mission-critical workloads across industries, offering the durability, flexibility, and performance required by modern applications. Whether you’re hosting a database, scaling a web tier, or building fault-tolerant systems, EBS is a foundational service for persistent, block-level storage in the cloud.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Amazon EBS Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a high-performance …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/aws/ebs/","tags":["aws","ebs","block storage","storage"],"title":""},{"body":" API Server The Kubernetes API Server is the central control plane component that exposes the Kubernetes API. All internal and external communication with the cluster—whether it’s deploying a new pod, querying resources, or applying a config change—goes through the API Server. It acts as the front door to the cluster, validating and processing REST requests, and then persisting the resource state in etcd.\nThe API Server serves as the bridge between human operators, automated tools (like kubectl or CI/CD pipelines), and the other control plane components like the scheduler, controller-manager, and admission controllers.\nTopics Benefits of Kubernetes API Server Centralized Access Point The API Server provides a single, well-defined interface for interacting with the entire Kubernetes cluster. Whether you’re accessing the system via kubectl, a Terraform script, or a monitoring tool, everything routes through the API Server. This helps maintain consistency and auditability across all cluster operations.\nValidation and Admission Control When you submit a request (e.g., deploying a pod or creating a ConfigMap), the API Server doesn’t just forward it blindly. It validates the schema, checks authentication and authorization rules, and applies admission controllers (like resource quotas or pod security policies). This ensures that only compliant, authorized, and valid configurations are allowed.\nExtensibility with CRDs The API Server is extensible by design. You can define Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes with your own APIs. This makes it possible to build custom operators and platform services that feel like native Kubernetes objects.\nUse Cases Declarative Cluster Management All configuration and desired state definitions in Kubernetes are communicated through the API Server. Whether you’re using kubectl apply -f, GitOps workflows, or Helm charts, the API Server is the gateway that translates your definitions into actual cluster state.\nAudit and Security Enforcement Because every action—whether triggered by users, automation, or internal processes—goes through the API Server, it becomes the ideal place to enforce audit logging, RBAC, and network security policies. This centralization helps secure your cluster and monitor what’s happening at all times.\nBest Practices Always enable authentication and authorization to protect your API endpoint.\nRestrict external access to the API Server using firewall rules or private endpoints.\nEnable audit logging to track who did what and when.\nApply rate limits and request size limits to protect against accidental or malicious misuse.\nRegularly update Kubernetes to patch any API Server vulnerabilities.\nThe Kubernetes API Server is the beating heart of the control plane. Without it, the cluster cannot be interacted with or reconfigured. A well-protected, scalable, and observable API Server is essential for the health and security of any Kubernetes environment.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" API Server The Kubernetes API Server is the central control plane …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/api_server/","tags":["kubernetes","control plane","api server","cluster management"],"title":""},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Explore blog content organized by AWS services","excerpt":"Explore blog content organized by AWS services","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/aws/","tags":"","title":"AWS Services"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Explore blog content organized by Azure services","excerpt":"Explore blog content organized by Azure services","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/azure/","tags":"","title":"Azure Services"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Explore blog content organized by AWS services","excerpt":"Explore blog content organized by AWS services","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/","tags":"","title":"Blogs"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Explore blog content organized by Docker","excerpt":"Explore blog content organized by Docker","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/docker/","tags":"","title":"Docker"},{"body":" Docker CLI The Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) is the primary tool for interacting with the Docker daemon. It enables developers and operators to build, manage, run, and inspect containers and images from a terminal.\nWith just a few commands, you can control the entire lifecycle of containers—from building images to running production workloads.\nTopics Benefits of Docker CLI Consistent and Scriptable Interface The CLI provides a unified, consistent experience across operating systems, making it ideal for scripting and automation in CI/CD pipelines. You can use shell scripts to automate container tasks like building, tagging, and pushing to a registry.\nFine-Grained Container Control From managing volumes and networks to inspecting container stats and logs, the CLI exposes fine-grained commands for in-depth control and troubleshooting. For example, docker exec lets you run a command inside a running container.\nFast Prototyping and Local Development Developers can quickly test code or services in containers by running docker run commands interactively—no need to write config files. This makes the CLI ideal for experimentation and debugging.\nWorks Seamlessly with Docker Engine The CLI communicates with the Docker Engine over a REST API, ensuring real-time execution and feedback. Commands like docker info, docker ps, and docker logs provide immediate visibility into the container environment.\nUse Cases Running local development environments using docker run, docker build, and docker exec. Managing images and containers on production servers with SSH access. Automating image builds with shell scripts in CI/CD workflows. Debugging issues by inspecting logs (docker logs) or opening a shell (docker exec -it). Managing resources like volumes, networks, and container limits. Best Practices Use --rm with docker run to clean up containers after exit in dev workflows. Use docker stats and docker top for real-time container monitoring. Use docker inspect to retrieve detailed metadata about containers or images. Combine with tools like jq for parsing JSON CLI output in scripts. Alias frequent commands (e.g., alias dps='docker ps -a') to boost productivity.

It is designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere, making it ideal for web applications, backups, media storage, and big data workloads.\nS3 stores data as objects within buckets, each consisting of the actual data, a key (unique name), and metadata. Its architecture supports virtually unlimited storage and seamless integration with many AWS services, making it a foundational component for cloud-native designs.\nTopics Versioning Storage Classes Pre-signed URLs Benefits of Amazon S3 Scalability S3 can seamlessly scale from gigabytes to exabytes of storage without manual intervention. For example, a startup uploading user photos can store millions of files without worrying about provisioning, and then grow into petabyte-scale data lakes as business expands.\nDurability and Availability Amazon S3 offers 11 9s (99.999999999%) of durability by redundantly storing data across multiple facilities. This means even in the rare case of hardware failure, your objects are safe. Multiple storage classes also allow tuning for availability and cost.\nUse Cases Backup and Restore S3 is an ideal destination for backing up databases, file systems, and applications. With versioning enabled, you can restore previous versions of files and protect against accidental deletions or overwrites.\nStatic Website Hosting S3 supports static website hosting, allowing developers to serve HTML, JS, CSS, and media assets directly from a bucket — great for landing pages, documentation, or single-page apps.\nBest Practices Enable versioning to protect against accidental data loss.\nUse lifecycle rules to transition data to cheaper storage.\nBlock public access unless explicitly required.\nEnable server-side encryption for compliance and security.\nMonitor access logs and integrate with CloudTrail.\nAmazon S3 is at the heart of AWS cloud storage.

It provides logical network isolation, enabling you to securely run virtual machines, containers, and applications while maintaining complete control over IP addressing, DNS, routing, and network security.\nVNets are analogous to traditional on-premises networks, but with the added scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration that Azure provides.\nTopics What is vnet Benefits of Azure VNet Secure Network Isolation Every VNet is logically isolated from others, giving you complete control over your network environment. You define custom IP address ranges, segment with subnets, and apply network security groups (NSGs) to manage traffic flow.\nFine-Grained Traffic Control You can enforce inbound and outbound rules at both subnet and NIC level using NSGs. Route tables allow custom traffic paths (e.g., to appliances or firewalls), and service endpoints or private endpoints let you securely connect to Azure services without internet exposure.\nPeering for Cross-VNet Communication VNet peering enables low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity between VNets — even across regions. It’s like extending your private network without using a gateway or public IPs.\nIntegration with On-Premises Networks You can use VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute to connect VNets to your on-prem infrastructure securely, enabling hybrid cloud setups where on-prem and cloud resources communicate seamlessly.\nDNS and Name Resolution VNets support custom DNS settings for internal name resolution. You can also integrate with Azure DNS Private Zones to maintain DNS control across complex setups.\nUse Cases Hosting Multi-Tier Applications Use subnets to separate web, application, and database layers. Apply NSGs to enforce least-privilege communication (e.g., only app subnet can reach the database).\nSecure Access to Azure Services Use private endpoints to connect securely to services like Azure Storage, SQL, and Key Vault — traffic never leaves Microsoft’s backbone network.\nHub-and-Spoke Network Topology Use one VNet as the hub for shared services (e.g., firewalls, DNS, jump boxes), and connect spoke VNets for individual applications or departments using VNet peering.\nHybrid Networking Use VPN Gateway to establish IPsec tunnels to on-premises networks, or ExpressRoute for high-performance, private connections with SLA guarantees.\nBest Practices Use CIDR blocks that don’t overlap with on-prem networks to simplify hybrid setups. Segment networks into subnets by function, not just size — this simplifies monitoring and policy enforcement. Use NSGs to apply least-privilege access rules. Monitor them regularly using Azure Network Watcher. Prefer VNet Peering over VPN for cross-region or intra-region connectivity unless regulatory requirements demand gateway separation. Tag VNets and subnets clearly to reflect their purpose, environment (dev/prod), or application. Azure VNets are essential for designing secure, scalable, and structured network environments in the cloud. They provide the control and flexibility you need to architect everything from simple test environments to complex, enterprise-grade hybrid solutions.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Virtual Network (VNet) Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/azure/virtual_network/","tags":["azure","networking","vnet","subnet","nsg","peering","isolation"],"title":""},{"body":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

It allows you to launch compute resources on-demand, with complete control over operating system, instance type, networking, and storage configurations.\nWith EC2, you can build flexible, resizable, and secure compute infrastructure without investing in physical hardware. Whether you’re deploying a single web server or a fleet of services across multiple regions, EC2 adapts to your scaling and performance needs.\nTopics Benefits of Amazon EC2 On-Demand Elasticity You can launch or terminate EC2 instances in minutes, making it ideal for dynamic scaling. For example, you can automatically increase capacity during peak traffic hours using Auto Scaling and reduce cost during idle periods.\nVariety of Instance Types EC2 offers a broad selection of instance types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or GPU workloads. Choose t4g or t3 instances for low-cost web servers, r6a for memory-intensive applications, or p5 for ML training workloads.\nIntegration with Other AWS Services EC2 integrates natively with services like ELB, IAM, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, and VPC. You can place your instances in private subnets, attach IAM roles for secure access, and stream logs to CloudWatch for observability.\nCustomization and Control You can choose your own AMIs (Amazon Machine Images), configure EBS volumes, attach Elastic IPs, and run startup scripts via user data. This is especially useful for building repeatable environments or immutable infrastructure.\nSecure by Design With security groups, NACLs, and IAM roles, EC2 provides deep controls for access, encryption, and compliance. You can run sensitive workloads in isolated subnets with no internet exposure.\nUse Cases Hosting Web and API Servers EC2 is commonly used for deploying web servers or backend APIs. For example, a Python FastAPI application can run on a t3.micro instance behind a load balancer with EBS for persistent storage and auto-scaling enabled for high availability.\nHigh-Performance Computing (HPC) EC2’s compute-optimized or GPU-powered instances can be used for simulations, rendering, or ML training. You can use c7gn or p5 instances for workloads requiring low latency and high throughput.\nDev/Test Environments You can create and destroy EC2 instances programmatically or via CI/CD to spin up environments for development, testing, or staging. This is cost-effective compared to maintaining permanent infrastructure.\nSelf-Hosted Databases and Tools If you want full control over database engines like PostgreSQL or self-hosted tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, or Vault, EC2 provides the flexibility to run and secure them as you prefer.\nBest Practices Use Auto Scaling to match capacity with demand. Choose the right instance family based on your CPU, memory, storage, and network needs. Use Spot Instances for non-critical or batch workloads to save cost. Enable termination protection for critical instances. Use IAM roles instead of storing credentials on instances. Regularly patch your AMIs and use AWS Systems Manager for automation. Amazon EC2 provides the raw compute power that underpins most cloud applications. From running a basic website to managing an entire production-grade architecture, EC2 delivers flexibility, performance, and global scalability.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Amazon EC2 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a foundational AWS …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/aws/ec2/","tags":["aws","ec2","compute","virtual machines"],"title":""},{"body":" Azure Kubernetes Service Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service by Microsoft Azure.

It allows Kubernetes to interact with your cloud provider’s APIs to provision and manage resources such as load balancers, block storage, and network routes.\nBefore the CCM existed, cloud provider logic was bundled into the core Kubernetes binaries. The CCM separates this logic, allowing cloud vendors to evolve independently and integrate Kubernetes in a more modular and scalable manner.\nTopics Benefits of Cloud Controller Manager Decoupled Cloud Integration By abstracting out cloud-specific logic from the core Kubernetes binaries, CCM promotes a clean separation of concerns. Kubernetes core can evolve independently, and cloud providers can implement and maintain their own plugins without touching upstream components.\nAutomated Infrastructure Provisioning The CCM can automatically provision and configure cloud infrastructure to match your Kubernetes specifications. For example:\nCreate a cloud load balancer when a Service of type LoadBalancer is deployed. Attach persistent volumes from your cloud’s block storage system when a PersistentVolumeClaim is made. Manage network routes and update them as nodes are added or removed. Consistent Multi-Cloud Support Cloud providers implement their own CCM interfaces, which means you can run Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, GCP, or other environments with consistent APIs and behaviors—while still taking advantage of native cloud features.\nUse Cases Load Balancer Automation When you expose a Kubernetes service as type: LoadBalancer, the CCM communicates with your cloud provider (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure Load Balancer, or GCP Network Load Balancer) to automatically provision and configure an external load balancer. This saves you from having to manually set up ingress endpoints.\nRoute Management For clusters running in environments that support overlay networking (e.g., AWS VPC or GCP VPC), the CCM configures and updates routing tables so that pods can communicate across nodes using their internal IPs.\nVolume Lifecycle Management With the PersistentVolume subsystem, the CCM ensures that block storage volumes (like AWS EBS or Azure Disks) are created, attached, and detached in sync with pod lifecycle events.\nBest Practices Use the official CCM for your cloud provider to ensure compatibility and support. Monitor the logs and metrics of the Cloud Controller Manager to detect provisioning issues early. If running in a private cloud or on-premise, consider whether you need CCM at all—or if you’d benefit from a custom implementation. For hybrid and multi-cloud environments, validate your CCM behavior thoroughly as cloud feature sets may vary. Always test cloud resource cleanup as part of your CI/CD or cluster teardown process to avoid orphaned infrastructure. The Cloud Controller Manager bridges the Kubernetes world with the underlying cloud provider, enabling native infrastructure automation without vendor lock-in. It’s a foundational piece for running cloud-native Kubernetes clusters at scale.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Cloud Controller Manager The Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) is a …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/cloud_controller_manager/","tags":["kubernetes","cloud integration","control plane"],"title":""},{"body":" Cloud Front Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users with low latency and high transfer speeds. By caching content in edge locations worldwide, CloudFront improves performance and reduces the load on origin servers.\nTopics Benefits of Amazon CloudFront Low Latency and High Performance CloudFront uses a global network of edge locations to cache and serve content close to users, reducing latency. For example, static assets like CSS, JS, or images for a web application are served from the nearest location, leading to noticeably faster page loads across regions.\nSecure Content Delivery CloudFront integrates seamlessly with AWS Shield and WAF for DDoS protection and request filtering. It supports HTTPS encryption, signed URLs, and georestriction, ensuring that content is delivered securely and only to intended audiences. This is particularly useful for delivering protected media streams or private APIs.\nUse Cases Website Acceleration Static websites hosted on S3 or dynamic web applications hosted on EC2 or containers can use CloudFront to cache and deliver their content globally. Regardless of the user’s geographic location, content is served from the nearest edge location, drastically improving page load speed and user experience.\nAPI and Software Distribution For RESTful APIs or downloadable software (e.g., installers, game assets, patches), CloudFront reduces latency and offloads origin servers by caching responses and files at edge locations. This enhances the performance and scalability of services with a global client base.\nBest Practices Use origin groups with failover to enhance reliability.\nEnable compression and cache policies for performance tuning.\nIntegrate WAF to block malicious requests.\nMonitor with CloudWatch metrics and real-time logs.\nCloudFront is essential for building modern, performant, and secure web architectures.

When versioning is enabled, S3 automatically stores a new version of the object every time it is modified or deleted — rather than overwriting or removing it.\nThis adds an extra layer of data protection and recovery, especially against accidental deletes or unintentional overwrites.\nHow Versioning Works Versioning is enabled at the bucket level. Once enabled, every object uploaded or modified will get a unique version ID. Deleting an object doesn’t remove it — instead, a delete marker is added. You can retrieve or restore previous versions anytime. Key Characteristics Version IDs are unique identifiers for each version of an object. Null version: Objects uploaded before versioning is enabled have a null version. Versioning cannot be fully disabled — only suspended once enabled. Supports lifecycle rules to manage older versions and clean up delete markers. Benefits of S3 Versioning Protection from Accidental Deletes\nDeleting an object only adds a delete marker. All previous versions remain recoverable. Safe Object Updates\nEvery PUT request creates a new version. Original versions remain intact and restorable. Audit and Change Tracking\nKeep track of changes to critical data over time. Useful in legal or compliance scenarios. Easy Integration with Lifecycle Rules\nConfigure rules to expire older versions or transition them to lower-cost storage. Real-World Use Cases Backup and Recovery\nProtect user uploads, logs, documents, and configs by keeping a history of changes.

It can also be used for domain registration and health checking of resources.\nWith Route 53, you can manage domain names, configure routing policies, and monitor endpoint health — all within a global, reliable infrastructure. It integrates well with other AWS services, making it ideal for cloud-native and hybrid environments.\nTopics Benefits of Amazon Route 53 Highly Available and Reliable Route 53 is designed using AWS’s global infrastructure and is backed by a 100% availability SLA. DNS records are propagated across multiple redundant edge locations, ensuring rapid and resilient name resolution.\nFlexible Routing Policies You can use a variety of routing policies — such as simple, failover, geolocation, latency-based, weighted, and multi-value answer — to control how users are directed to endpoints. For example, a latency-based policy ensures users reach the nearest regional endpoint for the lowest response time.\nHealth Checks and Failover Route 53 can monitor the health of your application endpoints (like EC2, ELB, or on-prem servers) and automatically reroute traffic to healthy resources. This helps in building fault-tolerant systems without extra infrastructure.\nDomain Registration and Management You can buy, transfer, and manage domain names directly via Route 53. AWS handles the DNS hosting and auto-renewal while offering full support for DNSSEC and WHOIS privacy.\nSeamless Integration with AWS You can route traffic to services like S3 static websites, CloudFront distributions, Elastic Load Balancers, or API Gateway endpoints with simple alias records, avoiding the need to manually manage IP addresses.\nUse Cases Hosting Websites and Web Apps Route 53 is widely used to point custom domain names to S3-hosted sites, EC2 instances, or load balancers. For example, www.example.com can be routed to a CloudFront distribution that serves your React frontend.\nGlobal Load Balancing Using latency-based or geolocation routing, you can serve content from the AWS region closest to your users, improving speed and availability. This is ideal for global SaaS platforms or media delivery.\nBlue-Green or Canary Deployments Weighted routing policies allow you to split traffic between multiple versions of your app. For instance, you could send 10% of users to your new backend and monitor results before a full switch.\nFailover for Disaster Recovery You can configure Route 53 to automatically route traffic to a standby site or region if the primary endpoint fails its health check, improving business continuity during outages.\nBest Practices Use alias records for AWS resources instead of hardcoded IP addresses. Configure TTL values appropriately for balancing DNS cache vs. change propagation. Enable health checks for critical endpoints and set up automated failover. Use multi-value answers to return multiple IPs for redundancy. Manage DNS zones and records through infrastructure as code (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform, Pulumi).

It also supports custom rules for additional filtering and blocking.\nSSL Termination and End-to-End TLS You can configure SSL certificates at the gateway to offload TLS decryption from backend servers. Optionally, you can re-encrypt traffic for end-to-end TLS, ensuring secure communication throughout.\nAutoscaling and Zone Redundancy App Gateway can scale automatically based on traffic load and supports Availability Zones, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance across Azure regions.\nURL-Based Routing and Multi-Site Hosting You can host multiple domains behind a single gateway and route traffic based on the incoming host name. For example, both api.example.com and app.example.com can be served via the same gateway with different backend pools.\nUse Cases Hosting Multiple Apps Behind a Single IP You can serve different apps (e.g., web frontend, backend APIs, admin portal) behind one public IP using host-based routing — reducing IP consumption and simplifying DNS management.\nWAF-Enabled Front Door for Web Applications Place App Gateway in front of Azure App Services, AKS, or VMs to act as a secure WAF front door that filters malicious traffic before reaching your backend.\nBlue-Green Deployments or A/B Testing Use path-based routing rules to split traffic between old and new versions of an application for gradual rollout, feature toggling, or canary testing.\nCentralized TLS Management Terminate and manage SSL certificates at the gateway instead of individual backend servers — making rotation and renewal easier to automate and maintain.\nBest Practices Always deploy App Gateway in Standard_v2 SKU or WAF_v2 SKU for autoscaling and performance benefits. Use custom health probes for backend health validation, especially for dynamic or containerized backends. Enable WAF in Detection mode initially, and review logs before switching to Prevention mode. Use Managed Identity to securely access certificates stored in Azure Key Vault. When hosting multi-site apps, always configure Host name matching in listeners and routing rules. Monitor performance and access logs using Azure Monitor and Diagnostic Settings. Azure Application Gateway provides fine-grained, secure, and scalable traffic control at the application layer — making it a foundational component for web app delivery and protection in Azure environments.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" App Gateway Azure Application Gateway is a Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/azure/application_gateway/","tags":["azure","application gateway","load balancing","waf"],"title":""},{"body":" Docker Compose Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file. It simplifies development, testing, and deployment by letting you manage services, volumes, and networks declaratively.\nInstead of running containers one-by-one, Compose lets you bring up the entire application stack with a single command: docker-compose up.\nTopics Benefits of Docker Compose Multi-Service Configuration Made Easy Compose lets you define all services, volumes, and networks in a single docker-compose.yml file. This reduces complexity and ensures that related containers (like a web app and database) are launched together.\nSimplifies Local Development It’s widely used for setting up local dev environments—start an app, DB, Redis cache, and background worker with one command. Restart everything with docker-compose restart. Great for collaborative dev teams.\nEnvironment-Specific Customization Compose supports overrides and environment files, so you can tailor configs for dev, test, or CI stages without modifying the main docker-compose.yml.\nScalable and CI-Friendly Though designed for local workflows, Compose can be used in CI pipelines for integration tests, or even deployed in Swarm mode for production workloads.\nUse Cases Developing full-stack applications (e.g., React + Node + PostgreSQL). Spinning up integration testing environments in CI pipelines. Creating disposable dev environments using docker-compose up and down. Managing complex apps locally with multiple services, ports, and dependencies. Simulating production setups locally using containerized stacks. Best Practices Use versioned docker-compose syntax (e.g., version: '3.8') for compatibility. Separate prod/dev configs using override files (docker-compose.override.yml). Always define named volumes and networks for portability and clarity. Use .env files for secrets and port configuration to avoid hardcoding values.

It acts as a target for route table entries and performs network address translation for public IPs.\nIGW is essential for any resource that needs to be accessed publicly or needs to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while being directly reachable.\nTopics why need igw Benefits of Internet Gateway Public Connectivity for VPC Resources By attaching an IGW to your VPC and adding route table entries, EC2 instances with public IPs can send and receive traffic from the internet. This is essential for services like public web servers, load balancers, or bastion hosts.\nScalable and Redundant Internet Gateway is managed by AWS and designed for high availability. You don’t need to provision or scale it manually — it handles internet-bound traffic from thousands of instances simultaneously.\nUse Cases Hosting Public Web Applications A typical three-tier architecture includes a public-facing EC2 instance (or ALB) that must be reachable over the internet. IGW enables this access while other backend resources remain private.\nSSH Access via Bastion Hosts To manage private EC2 instances securely, organizations often set up a bastion host in a public subnet with an IGW for remote access. Admins can SSH into this host and then jump into private instances.\nBest Practices Attach only one IGW per VPC.\nUse public subnets for resources that need internet access.\nEnsure route tables and security groups allow outbound/inbound traffic appropriately.\nAvoid assigning public IPs unless required — use NAT for egress from private subnets.\nAn Internet Gateway is a simple yet critical component in any AWS network architecture.

It supports both public and internal scenarios, making it suitable for internet-facing services and private application tiers alike.\nIt is ideal when low latency, high throughput, and high availability are required — such as for gaming, VoIP, or traditional enterprise applications that use TCP or UDP protocols.\nTopics What is load balancer Benefits of Azure Load Balancer High Throughput with Ultra-Low Latency Azure Load Balancer is built for performance-critical applications. It can handle millions of flows per second with minimal latency. This makes it ideal for backend services such as database access proxies or real-time applications.\nTCP/UDP Layer 4 Load Balancing It works at the transport layer, distributing connections purely based on source/destination IP and port. It supports both TCP and UDP protocols, unlike Azure Application Gateway which only handles HTTP/S.\nHealth Probes for Real-Time Monitoring You can define custom health probes to detect VM failure. If a backend becomes unhealthy, the Load Balancer stops sending traffic to it until it recovers.\nPublic and Internal Load Balancing Public Load Balancer: Routes traffic from the internet to Azure resources (e.g., exposing VMs, NAT-ing services). Internal Load Balancer (ILB): Routes traffic within your VNet — great for load-balancing between backend tiers (e.g., web → API → database). Outbound SNAT and Port Forwarding For VMs without public IPs, Load Balancer enables outbound connectivity through source NAT. It also supports Inbound NAT rules to map specific ports on the frontend to backend VMs for RDP or SSH access.\nUse Cases Multi-Tier Application Load Balancing Use a public load balancer for frontend traffic (e.g., from users) and an internal load balancer to distribute traffic to backend services (e.g., internal APIs or databases).\nScaling Legacy TCP/UDP Applications Distribute traffic for protocols like SMTP, DNS, FTP, or gaming servers that rely on non-HTTP communication.\nOutbound Internet Access for Private VMs If your backend VMs don’t have public IPs, associate them with a Load Balancer to enable outbound traffic for updates, telemetry, or external service calls.\nNAT Access to VMs Use Inbound NAT rules to RDP or SSH into individual VMs via the same public IP and different ports — especially useful in test/dev environments with multiple VMs.\nBest Practices Prefer Standard SKU for production — it supports Availability Zones, is secure by default, and provides better performance than Basic. Always configure custom health probes that validate application-layer functionality (e.g., return code on /health) rather than just checking TCP connectivity. Combine Load Balancer with Availability Sets or VM Scale Sets to ensure traffic is always routed to healthy instances. If using a Standard SKU Public Load Balancer, ensure NSG rules explicitly allow the required inbound/outbound traffic — it’s secure by default. Monitor performance using Azure Monitor metrics like DipAvailability, SnatPortUtilization, and packet drops. Azure Load Balancer provides fast, reliable, and cost-effective traffic distribution across your network resources, especially where non-HTTP(S) traffic or raw TCP/UDP performance is critical.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Load Balancer Azure Load Balancer is a high-performance, Layer 4 …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/azure/load_balancer/","tags":["azure","load balancer","layer 4","tcp","udp","inbound nat","outbound rules"],"title":""},{"body":" Local Network Gateway Azure Local Network Gateway represents your on-premises VPN device and network in Azure.

Use BGP where possible to simplify route management. Keep IP address prefixes updated in the Local Network Gateway to avoid route mismatches. Monitor VPN connection health via Azure Network Watcher and alerts. When IP changes occur on your on-prem VPN device, update the gateway IP promptly. Azure Local Network Gateway plays a vital role in hybrid architectures, bridging the gap between on-prem infrastructure and cloud environments with secure, reliable VPN connectivity.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Local Network Gateway Azure Local Network Gateway represents your …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/azure/local_network_gateway/","tags":["azure","local network gateway","vpn","hybrid connectivity"],"title":""},{"body":" NAT Gateway A NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway is a managed AWS service that enables instances in a private subnet to access the internet outbound only, without exposing them to inbound internet traffic. This separation of responsibilities allows you to maintain a secure networking model where sensitive backend systems remain isolated while still being able to reach external services as needed.\nFor example, an EC2 instance running in a private subnet (e.g., a database or internal API service) can use a NAT Gateway to pull security patches, connect to public APIs, or download software packages — all without making the instance publicly accessible.\nTopics why need nat gw Traffic to internet Benefits of NAT Gateway Simplified Outbound Connectivity for Private Subnets Instead of managing your own NAT instance (which requires patching, scaling, and monitoring), NAT Gateway offers a fully managed, resilient solution that handles all outbound traffic from private subnets. For example, if you have a backend EC2 instance in a private subnet that needs to install packages from an external repository, NAT Gateway ensures seamless access to the internet without exposing your instance to inbound threats.\nHigh Availability and Scalability NAT Gateway is designed to be highly available within an Availability Zone, and it automatically scales to accommodate up to 45 Gbps of throughput. This ensures consistent performance even in high-traffic environments. Imagine a fleet of application servers downloading large models or patch sets — NAT Gateway will manage the bandwidth dynamically without any manual intervention.\nEnhanced Security Posture By default, private subnet resources using a NAT Gateway cannot be reached from the internet, significantly reducing the attack surface. You retain complete control via route tables, security groups, and NACLs. For instance, your RDS database might need to contact an external payment service — NAT Gateway allows that without exposing the database publicly.\nUse Cases Private EC2 Instances Downloading OS Updates In many architectures, EC2 instances in private subnets host core services like app backends, microservices, or schedulers. These systems often need to pull OS updates, language runtimes, or container images from the internet. A NAT Gateway allows this while maintaining their non-public nature, ensuring they aren’t reachable from the outside world.\nAccessing External APIs from Secure Internal Systems A private subnet EC2 instance or Lambda function may need to interact with third-party APIs — for example, fetching stock data, sending metrics to an external observability tool, or integrating with a SaaS platform. NAT Gateway enables this communication while preserving network isolation from the public internet.\nBest Practices Create one NAT Gateway per Availability Zone to ensure resilience across zones.\nUse route tables to tightly control which subnets use the NAT Gateway.\nPair NAT Gateway with CloudWatch metrics and VPC Flow Logs for visibility.\nAvoid using NAT Gateway for high-volume content downloads — consider alternatives like S3 VPC endpoints when accessing AWS services.\nRestrict egress traffic using security groups, NACLs, or egress-only IGWs where appropriate.\nNAT Gateway plays a critical role in modern cloud network architecture. It provides a clean, secure bridge between private subnets and the internet — allowing your workloads to operate effectively without compromising on isolation or governance. Whether it’s patching servers, calling third-party APIs, or downloading packages, NAT Gateway ensures smooth and safe outbound access.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" NAT Gateway A NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway is a managed …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/aws/nat_gw/","tags":["aws","nat gateway","networking","vpc","egress","internet access"],"title":""},{"body":" S3 | Pre-signed URLs Pre-signed URLs Pre-signed URLs grant temporary access to S3 objects without making them publicly accessible.\nUse Cases Secure File Sharing: Share access to private files securely.

Unlike a regular Role, which is namespace-scoped, a ClusterRole is cluster-scoped and can grant access to non-namespaced resources (like nodes, persistent volumes) or apply permissions uniformly across multiple namespaces.\nClusterRoles are essential in defining RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) policies for service accounts, users, or groups that need broad or infrastructure-level access within a Kubernetes environment.\nTopics Benefits of ClusterRole Enables Cluster-Wide Access Control With ClusterRoles, administrators can define access policies that apply to resources across all namespaces — or even to global resources that don’t belong to any namespace. For example, assigning permissions to view all pods in every namespace or granting access to resources like nodes, persistentvolumes, or clusterroles themselves.\nThis is useful for monitoring agents, backup tools, or platform automation controllers that need visibility or action at the cluster level.\nCentralized Permission Templates ClusterRoles act as reusable permission sets. You can bind a single ClusterRole to multiple users or service accounts using ClusterRoleBindings, ensuring consistency across the system. This also simplifies updates — modify the ClusterRole once, and all bindings reflect the change.\nFor instance, a custom ClusterRole for read-only access to all workloads can be shared across development and QA teams, eliminating repetitive RBAC definitions.\nSupports Both Namespaced and Non-Namespaced Resources Although ClusterRoles are often associated with cluster-scoped resources, they can also define permissions on namespaced resources. When bound with a RoleBinding inside a namespace, a ClusterRole can effectively act as a global role template applied selectively.\nThis provides maximum flexibility when designing permission schemes across diverse teams or environments.\nUse Cases Granting Read-Only Access to All Namespaces You can create a ClusterRole that allows get, list, and watch for core resources like pods, deployments, and services, and bind it to a user or group. This is commonly used for developers, observability tools, or auditors.\nEnabling Node and Volume Management Admins or infrastructure operators might need access to manage nodes, persistentvolumes, or certificatesigningrequests, which are cluster-level resources. A ClusterRole can define these permissions, and a ClusterRoleBinding ensures appropriate access across the system.\nService Accounts for Controllers and Operators Custom operators often run with service accounts that require elevated, cross-namespace permissions. Using ClusterRoles, you can define exactly what these components can access or modify — avoiding over-permissive bindings while still enabling automation.\nBest Practices Use ClusterRole only when access across namespaces or to cluster-level resources is necessary.\nAvoid using ClusterRoleBinding for human users unless absolutely required. Prefer namespace-scoped RoleBinding + ClusterRole instead.\nDefine least-privilege policies — only allow specific verbs and resources required by the subject.\nName ClusterRoles clearly to reflect purpose, like view-all-pods or node-manager.\nAudit permissions periodically using kubectl auth can-i or tools like rbac-lookup or rakkess.\nClusterRole is a foundational component in Kubernetes security, enabling scalable and flexible access control across the cluster.

It is a critical part of Kubernetes’ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system and enables centralized access control for global or cross-namespace actions.\nWhile a ClusterRole defines what actions are allowed, the ClusterRoleBinding defines who gets those permissions and where they apply. ClusterRoleBindings apply cluster-wide, unlike RoleBinding, which is restricted to a specific namespace.\nTopics Benefits of ClusterRoleBinding Cluster-Wide Subject Binding ClusterRoleBindings allow binding a ClusterRole to a subject (user, group, or service account) at the cluster scope, making them ideal for system-level access. This means the subject can perform actions across all namespaces or on cluster-scoped resources like nodes, persistentvolumes, and namespaces.\nFor example, you can bind a monitoring tool’s service account to a ClusterRole that allows reading all resources across namespaces — simplifying observability setup.\nEnables Infrastructure and Platform Automation Controllers, operators, CI/CD tools, and infrastructure agents often require broad access to manage workloads or perform system operations. ClusterRoleBindings ensure these tools can interact with the cluster reliably, without manual namespace-by-namespace access grants.\nThis is essential for components like ingress controllers, node autoscalers, or certificate managers that need full-cluster visibility.\nFlexible Access Patterns with Namespaced Support Even though ClusterRoleBindings grant cluster-wide access, they can also be used to bind ClusterRoles that include namespaced permissions. This allows defining reusable roles centrally while binding them globally or locally depending on access strategy.\nUse Cases Granting Admin Access to Cluster Operators For cluster administrators or SRE teams, a ClusterRoleBinding can be used to bind the built-in cluster-admin ClusterRole to their identities. This grants full access across the cluster, typically used for bootstrapping and cluster maintenance.\nProviding Read-Only Access Across Namespaces If a developer or service account needs read-only access to all resources (pods, services, deployments) across all namespaces, a ClusterRole can be created with get, list, and watch, and then bound using a ClusterRoleBinding.\nThis is common for dashboards, logging/monitoring tools, and external audit systems.\nAutomating Certificate Approval with cert-manager Tools like cert-manager use service accounts that require access to approve or sign CertificateSigningRequests. These are cluster-scoped resources and require a ClusterRoleBinding to function correctly.\nBest Practices Use ClusterRoleBinding only when access must span the entire cluster.\nPrefer RoleBinding for namespace-scoped access, even when using a ClusterRole.\nLimit usage of cluster-admin role — define custom ClusterRoles with only required permissions.\nAlways follow least privilege: bind only necessary verbs and resources.\nReview and audit ClusterRoleBindings regularly using tools like kubectl auth can-i or rakkess.\nClusterRoleBinding is a powerful RBAC primitive that enables cluster-wide access control for users and service accounts. When designed carefully, it ensures secure and scalable permissions management — whether you’re enabling automation, observability, or shared platform operations.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Cluster Role Binding A ClusterRoleBinding in Kubernetes connects a …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/cluster_role_binding/","tags":["kubernetes","rbac","security","authorization"],"title":""},{"body":" NAT Gateway Azure NAT Gateway provides outbound Internet connectivity for resources inside an Azure Virtual Network in a secure, scalable, and efficient manner.

Using YAML or JSON templates, you can define your cloud infrastructure — from EC2 instances and VPCs to IAM roles and Lambda functions — and deploy them as stacks with a single command or API call.\nCloudFormation eliminates the need for manual configuration, reduces human error, and enables you to version control your infrastructure just like your application code. It’s widely used in DevOps workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and platform automation.\nTopics Benefits of CloudFormation Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Full Version Control CloudFormation allows you to declare your infrastructure in text files using YAML or JSON. This makes it easy to track changes in version control systems like Git, enabling collaboration, auditing, and rollback. For example, if a team decides to modify the subnet structure in a VPC, the change can be peer-reviewed in a pull request — just like application code.\nAutomated and Repeatable Deployments Templates ensure repeatability — whether you’re launching a single development environment or dozens of identical stacks across regions. A CloudFormation template can provision networking, storage, compute, and IAM roles consistently without manual steps. This is especially powerful for companies maintaining multiple environments (dev, test, prod) that must stay in sync.\nDependency Management and Rollback CloudFormation understands resource dependencies and automatically manages creation order. If a deployment fails, it automatically rolls back to the previous known-good state. For instance, if an IAM role creation fails midway through a stack update, CloudFormation will revert all previous changes, preserving infrastructure integrity.\nUse Cases Environment Provisioning for Dev/Test/Prod Organizations can use CloudFormation to spin up entire environments — VPCs, subnets, databases, application servers — with a single command. This allows developers to have dedicated, identical environments for development and testing without configuration drift.\nAutomating Multi-Tier Applications Complex applications that span networking, compute, security, and storage can be defined as modular templates and deployed together as a stack. For example, an app with an ALB, ECS cluster, RDS database, and associated IAM policies can be fully automated using nested stacks and parameters.\nBest Practices Break large templates into modular nested stacks for reusability.\nUse Parameters, Mappings, and Conditions to make templates dynamic.\nLeverage StackSets to deploy across multiple accounts and regions.\nIntegrate with CodePipeline or CI/CD tools to automate deployments.\nTag all resources for cost tracking and governance.\nUse Change Sets to preview changes before applying them.\nCloudFormation empowers teams to treat infrastructure like software — codified, peer-reviewed, versioned, and automated. Whether you’re launching a single stack or managing thousands across regions and accounts, CloudFormation provides the foundation for scalable, governed, and reliable cloud deployments.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Cloud Formation AWS CloudFormation is a powerful Infrastructure as …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/aws/cloudformation/","tags":["aws","cloudformation","infrastructure-as-code","iac","automation"],"title":""},{"body":" ConfigMap A ConfigMap in Kubernetes is an API object used to store non-sensitive configuration data as key-value pairs. It allows application configuration to be externalized from container images, enabling separation of config and code — a core principle of modern cloud-native architecture.\nConfigMaps are especially useful for injecting environment-specific settings, URLs, flags, or app-level parameters without needing to rebuild or redeploy your application containers.\nTopics Benefits of ConfigMap Decouples Configuration from Application Logic By separating runtime configuration from the container image, you can use the same Docker image across different environments (dev, staging, prod) simply by referencing different ConfigMaps. This reduces operational complexity and promotes consistency.\nFor example, an app may read database URLs or feature flags from a ConfigMap instead of hardcoding them.\nEasy to Mount or Inject ConfigMaps can be exposed to pods in multiple ways — as environment variables, mounted volumes, or directly read through the Kubernetes API. This provides flexibility depending on the application’s design or runtime requirements.\nFor instance, a Java app might read from environment variables, while a Go service might read directly from files mounted via a ConfigMap volume.\nSupports Declarative Configuration Management Because ConfigMaps are standard Kubernetes resources, they can be stored as YAML files, versioned in Git, and applied using GitOps workflows. This makes application configuration reproducible, traceable, and auditable.\nUse Cases Environment-Specific App Settings Different environments often require different values — such as API base URLs, log levels, or third-party credentials (non-sensitive). ConfigMaps let you define these separately without rebuilding your images.\nFeature Toggles and Runtime Flags Applications can enable or disable features dynamically using values pulled from a ConfigMap. This allows safer deployments where new features can be toggled without restarting services.\nInjecting Config for Sidecars or Init Containers Sidecars like logging agents or service mesh proxies often rely on user-defined configuration. A ConfigMap can be mounted as a file path, allowing complex structured config (e.g., JSON, YAML) to be read by the sidecar.\nBest Practices Avoid putting secrets in ConfigMaps — use Secrets for sensitive data.\nUse a consistent naming convention per environment and namespace.\nValidate ConfigMap contents before applying to avoid runtime errors.\nLeverage kubectl --dry-run and GitOps pipelines to test and version changes.\nMount large or structured configs (like JSON) as files rather than env vars.\nConfigMap provides a clean, declarative, and environment-agnostic way to manage configuration in Kubernetes.

It’s used for automating recurring tasks like backups, cleanup scripts, report generation, or health checks — all within the Kubernetes ecosystem.\nCronJobs extend the Job API by adding a scheduling layer, ensuring that jobs are launched at precise, recurring times as defined by the user.\nTopics Benefits of CronJob Declarative Scheduled Automation With CronJobs, you define when a job should run using familiar cron syntax (\"0 0 * * *\" for daily runs). Kubernetes takes care of launching the job at the right time, retrying on failure, and managing the job lifecycle.\nThis makes it ideal for automating routine operations without requiring external schedulers.\nScalable and Cluster-Native CronJobs are fully managed by the Kubernetes control plane, meaning they scale well and fit naturally into your cluster. Jobs are scheduled like any other workload and run in containers, allowing you to write and deploy scripts in any language or runtime.\nFor example, a containerized Python script can be run weekly to clean up stale data from a database.\nHistory Tracking and Lifecycle Control You can configure how many successful or failed job runs to retain, giving you visibility into past executions and outcomes. This aids in debugging and monitoring.\nUse Cases Nightly Database Backups A CronJob can be scheduled to back up a PostgreSQL or MySQL database every night at midnight. The job might compress and upload the backup to S3, providing automated, recurring disaster recovery.\nLog Rotation and Cleanup To manage disk space and reduce clutter, CronJobs can periodically delete old log files, archive rotated logs, or clean up expired Kubernetes resources like pods or completed jobs.\nRegular Health and Metrics Checks Teams can run sanity checks or metrics collectors at fixed intervals using CronJobs. This is especially useful for legacy systems or services where real-time observability is not yet built-in.\nBest Practices Always specify .startingDeadlineSeconds to prevent missed job runs.\nSet .concurrencyPolicy to Forbid or Replace to avoid overlapping executions.\nUse .successfulJobsHistoryLimit and .failedJobsHistoryLimit to retain relevant job logs.\nEnsure containerized jobs complete quickly and exit cleanly.\nAvoid scheduling too many high-frequency jobs that can overload the cluster.\nCronJobs offer a reliable and native way to schedule recurring tasks inside Kubernetes.

CRDs are the foundation of the Kubernetes extensibility model and enable the creation of custom controllers and operators that behave like native Kubernetes resources.\nUsing CRDs, teams can define custom objects such as BackupPolicy, Database, MLJob, or IngressRoute with their own schema, lifecycle, and automation logic — all managed declaratively just like built-in objects (Pod, Service, etc.).\nTopics Benefits of CRD Extends Kubernetes Without Modifying Core CRDs allow developers to introduce new resource types into the cluster without having to modify or rebuild Kubernetes itself. Once a CRD is installed, users can interact with it using kubectl, apply YAML files, or integrate it into GitOps flows — just like standard resources.\nFor example, after installing a BackupPolicy CRD, users can run kubectl get backuppolicies to view and manage their own backup definitions.\nEnables Domain-Specific APIs and Automation CRDs form the basis for building Kubernetes Operators — custom controllers that watch for changes in these custom resources and act accordingly. This enables complex domain logic to be encoded into reusable Kubernetes-native APIs.\nA Database CRD, for instance, might trigger provisioning of a cloud database, manage failover, backups, and updates — all through declarative YAML manifests.\nNative Integration with RBAC and Validation CRDs automatically integrate with Kubernetes features like:\nRBAC: You can define fine-grained access to custom resources. Admission controllers: Use validation webhooks or OpenAPI schemas. Events and status fields: Just like standard resources, CRDs support .status, enabling status reporting and error feedback. Use Cases Building a Kubernetes Operator Operators rely on CRDs to define their custom domain logic. For example, the Prometheus Operator defines CRDs like ServiceMonitor and AlertmanagerConfig, enabling users to configure monitoring entirely through Kubernetes resources.\nManaging External or Complex Infrastructure CRDs can be used to declaratively manage cloud services like S3 buckets, DNS records, or IAM roles by syncing desired state to the actual infrastructure via controllers. This allows teams to treat external systems as native Kubernetes objects.\nInternal Platform APIs Platform teams often create internal CRDs to expose higher-level abstractions — like AppDeployment or TenantQuota. These encapsulate complex deployments or policies behind simplified APIs for developers to consume.\nBest Practices Define a validation schema to ensure custom resources are predictable.\nKeep CRD names consistent and follow plural naming conventions (e.g., databases.example.com).\nAvoid overly broad permissions in RBAC rules for custom resources.\nSeparate CRD management from application logic — use Helm, Kustomize, or GitOps to version CRDs.\nUse .status fields and conditions for clear lifecycle visibility and health reporting.\nCustom Resource Definitions are at the heart of Kubernetes extensibility.

It’s typically used for deploying background system services like log collectors, monitoring agents, or storage daemons that must be present on all nodes.\nWhen a new node is added to the cluster, the DaemonSet controller automatically schedules the DaemonSet pod on it — making DaemonSet ideal for cluster-wide infrastructure agents.\nTopics Benefits of DaemonSet Cluster-Wide Uniform Workload Distribution DaemonSets guarantee that one instance of the pod runs on each node, providing uniform behavior across the cluster. This is essential for agents that need host-level access, such as fluentd, promtail, or node-level backup tools.\nBy ensuring every node has a copy of the workload, DaemonSets help maintain consistent observability, security, and data collection.\nAutomatic Handling of Node Additions As new nodes join the cluster, DaemonSet pods are automatically scheduled onto them without any user intervention. This simplifies operational tasks and ensures your monitoring, logging, or policy enforcement is applied uniformly.\nFine-Grained Targeting with Node Selectors and Taints DaemonSets can be configured to run only on specific types of nodes by using labels, taints, or affinity rules. For instance, you might run a GPU monitoring DaemonSet only on nodes labeled with gpu=true.\nUse Cases Log and Metrics Collection Logging agents like Fluentd, Logstash, or vector are often deployed as DaemonSets to collect container logs from every node and forward them to a central store like Elasticsearch or Loki.\nNetwork and Security Enforcement Tools like Calico or Cilium use DaemonSets to apply network policies, manage CNI plugins, or enforce firewall rules uniformly across all nodes.\nNode-Level Backups and Volume Management Backup agents or CSI drivers often need host-level access to volumes. DaemonSets are ideal for placing such components on every node to handle disk mounting, backup orchestration, or encryption.\nBest Practices Use tolerations and affinity rules to restrict DaemonSets to relevant nodes.\nAvoid scheduling user workloads using DaemonSets — reserve it for infrastructure components.\nSet resource requests/limits to avoid node overload.\nUse RollingUpdate strategy for safe updates (since 1.6+).\nMonitor with metrics and alerts to ensure all expected nodes are running the DaemonSet.\nDaemonSets are a critical construct for deploying per-node infrastructure in Kubernetes.

Kubernetes ensures the actual cluster state matches the desired state, offering a clean GitOps-compatible way to manage workloads.\nRolling Updates and Rollbacks Kubernetes automatically performs rolling updates, gradually replacing old pods with new ones while maintaining availability. If something goes wrong, a rollback can be triggered to return to a previous working version.\nThis allows safe and gradual upgrades with minimal downtime.\nEasy Scaling and Lifecycle Management Scaling a deployment is as simple as changing the replicas count. Kubernetes handles the orchestration, scheduling, and health checks automatically. You can also pause/resume updates or trigger restarts programmatically or through kubectl.\nUse Cases Running Web Applications and APIs Stateless workloads like frontend services, backend APIs, or web servers are typically run as Deployments.

For example, if CPU usage exceeds a set threshold, HPA increases the number of pod replicas to maintain performance.\nThis makes applications resilient under variable loads without manual intervention.\nCost Efficiency Through Downscaling When load decreases, HPA reduces the number of pods, saving compute resources. This helps optimize cloud costs and keeps your cluster lean, especially in dev/test environments or during off-peak hours.\nCustom Metrics for Advanced Autoscaling Beyond CPU and memory, HPA can use custom or external metrics (like queue length, HTTP request rate, or business KPIs) via the Kubernetes metrics pipeline. This allows you to scale based on what actually matters to your app.\nUse Cases Traffic-Based Scaling for APIs and Services Web APIs and microservices often experience fluctuating traffic. HPA keeps your services responsive by automatically scaling out during traffic surges and scaling in afterward.\nBatch Job Load Management If certain jobs cause CPU spikes, HPA helps maintain stability by increasing capacity temporarily — ensuring job performance remains steady across changing conditions.\nReal-World Signals like Queue Depth Using custom metrics (via Prometheus Adapter or External Metrics API), HPA can scale based on signals like Kafka topic depth or Redis queue length — ideal for real-time data systems.\nBest Practices Use requests.cpu and requests.memory on your pods — HPA relies on these values.\nUse readinessProbes so that newly scaled pods are not considered ready until healthy.\nDon’t set minReplicas: 0 unless your workload can truly tolerate downtime.\nCombine with Cluster Autoscaler to scale nodes when needed.\nVisualize and tune metrics using Prometheus or Kubernetes Dashboard.\nThe Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is essential for building self-adjusting, cost-efficient, and production-grade workloads in Kubernetes.

It provides routing rules, TLS termination, and host/path-based routing, acting as a smarter and more efficient alternative to exposing services via LoadBalancer or NodePort.\nIngress sits at the application layer (Layer 7) and typically works with ingress controllers like NGINX, Traefik, or cloud-native controllers.\nTopics Benefits of Ingress Centralized Traffic Management Ingress consolidates traffic routing rules into a single configuration point. Instead of exposing each service individually, you can route multiple apps using one load balancer — based on path, subdomain, or HTTP headers.\nThis reduces complexity and cost.\nTLS Termination and Security Ingress supports TLS certificates for secure HTTPS connections and lets you terminate SSL at the ingress level — keeping your internal services simple and unencrypted.\nYou can use self-managed certs or integrate with Let’s Encrypt for automated provisioning.\nCustom Routing Logic Using annotations and custom rules, Ingress can handle complex routing scenarios — redirecting URLs, rewriting paths, enforcing authentication, rate limiting, and more. Ingress is highly extensible through its controller.\nUse Cases Hosting Multiple Services on One Domain With Ingress, you can route /api to your backend, /admin to your dashboard, and / to your frontend — all from a single DNS entry.\nPublic-Facing TLS with Cert-Manager Automate HTTPS provisioning using cert-manager and Let’s Encrypt. Ingress handles certificate renewal, secure routing, and HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.\nMulti-Tenant Applications Ingress allows per-tenant subdomain or path-based routing, enabling SaaS-style isolation (e.g., tenant1.example.com, tenant2.example.com).\nBest Practices Use a robust ingress controller like NGINX or Traefik with autoscaling.\nAvoid wild wildcard rules that may lead to unintended routing behavior.\nUse cert-manager for automated TLS lifecycle management.\nEnable health checks and observability for your ingress controller.\nSecure ingress endpoints with WAF, rate-limiting, or external auth if exposed to internet.\nIngress is the gateway to your Kubernetes cluster — combining load balancing, reverse proxy, and SSL termination into one elegant solution. It helps expose your apps reliably and securely to the outside world.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Ingress A Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that manages external …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/ingress/","tags":["kubernetes","networking","reverse-proxy","loadbalancer"],"title":"Kubernetes Ingress"},{"body":" Job A Kubernetes Job ensures that a pod completes successfully one or more times. It’s used for batch and short-lived tasks like data processing, backups, or report generation — in contrast to Deployments which manage long-running services.\nJobs handle retry logic, completion tracking, and parallel executions, giving you control over how and when pods run until their tasks finish.\nTopics Benefits of Jobs Guaranteed Task Completion Jobs run pods until the specified number of successful completions is reached. If a pod fails, the Job controller retries with a new pod — ensuring eventual success without manual intervention.\nSupport for Parallel or Sequential Runs Jobs can run multiple pods in parallel (.spec.parallelism) or sequentially, depending on your use case. This makes them flexible for different kinds of batch workloads like map-reduce or migration scripts.\nOne-Time or On-Demand Tasks Jobs are perfect for tasks that need to run once per trigger, like database seeding, test execution, or cleanup logic. You create them when needed, and Kubernetes handles the rest.\nUse Cases Data Processing Pipelines Jobs can be triggered to process batches of data pulled from storage or message queues. When done, the pods shut down cleanly.\nInfrastructure Tasks Use Jobs for one-off ops tasks: DB migration, cache warming, or snapshot creation — all without building external automation tools.\nScheduled Work with CronJob Jobs are the building block for CronJobs, which schedule jobs periodically (e.g., “run every day at 2 AM”).\nBest Practices Always set backoffLimit to control retry behavior.\nUse ttlSecondsAfterFinished to clean up completed jobs automatically.\nMount ConfigMaps or Secrets for dynamic job configuration.\nTag your jobs with meaningful labels for observability.\nUse resource requests/limits to avoid starving other workloads.\nKubernetes Jobs are your go-to mechanism for handling time-bound or on-demand tasks.

It manages the virtual network rules that allow Pods to communicate with Services, handling routing and forwarding at the network layer using mechanisms like iptables, ipvs, or eBPF.\nIt’s the silent worker that makes service discovery and networking possible within the cluster.\nTopics Key Responsibilities Virtual IP and Port Forwarding When a Service is created, kube-proxy sets up rules to forward traffic from the cluster IP and port to one of the associated pods. This load balancing is transparent and efficient.\nDynamic Updates As pods scale or restart, kube-proxy updates its routing rules accordingly. No need to reconfigure anything manually — it reacts to changes in real-time based on the Kubernetes API.\nMultiple Backends: iptables, IPVS, eBPF Depending on cluster configuration and kernel support, kube-proxy can use:\niptables: simple rule-based packet forwarding IPVS: more performant load balancing eBPF: modern, programmable kernel-based proxying (when supported) Use Cases Service Abstraction kube-proxy makes it possible for Service objects to work. It hides pod IP churn from clients and ensures that traffic always reaches a healthy backend.\nLoad Balancing Without External Tools By handling L4 load balancing internally, kube-proxy eliminates the need for external HAProxy/Nginx setups — at least within the cluster boundary.\nBridging DNS to Pods When a pod calls myservice.default.svc.cluster.local, kube-proxy ensures the request reaches the correct pod via ClusterIP and port.\nBest Practices Use IPVS mode for better performance in production environments.\nEnsure kube-proxy is healthy and running on all nodes — it’s essential for networking.\nAvoid manually modifying iptables rules on nodes running kube-proxy.\nUse observability tools to monitor dropped packets or misrouted traffic.\nEnable metrics export if supported by your distribution (e.g., via Prometheus).\nkube-proxy quietly powers much of the magic in Kubernetes networking — from ClusterIP services to inter-pod communication. Without it, services wouldn’t know where to go.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Kube Proxy kube-proxy is a core component that runs on every …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/kube_proxy/","tags":["kubernetes","networking","proxy","iptables","services"],"title":""},{"body":" Kubelet kubelet is the primary node agent in Kubernetes. It runs on every node and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of pods assigned to that node. It interacts with the container runtime (e.g., containerd or Docker), ensuring containers are running, healthy, and conforming to spec.\nWithout kubelet, your node is invisible to the control plane.\nTopics Key Responsibilities Pod Lifecycle Management kubelet watches the Kubernetes API for any pods scheduled to its node. It then creates, monitors, restarts, or cleans up containers as needed based on the PodSpec.\nNode Registration \u0026 Heartbeat kubelet registers the node with the cluster and periodically sends status updates (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage, conditions) to the control plane to indicate it’s healthy and available.\nHealth Checks \u0026 Readiness It executes liveness and readiness probes for pods. This helps Kubernetes decide whether a container is healthy or ready to serve traffic.\nLog \u0026 Metric Access kubelet exposes logs and metrics (via /metrics and /stats/summary) that are essential for monitoring and debugging node-level behavior.\nUse Cases Bootstrapping a new worker node Managing container runtime interaction Node-level troubleshooting Custom kubelet configuration for edge/IoT workloads Hosting local static pods (e.g., CoreDNS or custom agents) Best Practices Always run the kubelet as a systemd service with appropriate flags. Use --read-only-port=0 to disable insecure access. Limit resource usage using --kube-reserved and --system-reserved. Set up proper TLS bootstrap or authentication modes for security. Monitor logs (journalctl -u kubelet) for node-level issues. kubelet is the heartbeat of each Kubernetes node.

It’s like a virtual sub-cluster within the main cluster, allowing teams, applications, or environments to operate independently — but still share the underlying infrastructure.\nTopics Benefits of Namespaces Resource Isolation Separate teams or workloads can have their own space, reducing the risk of accidental interference. Dev, test, and prod environments can all coexist without stepping on each other’s toes.\nAccess Control via RBAC Namespaces work hand-in-hand with RoleBindings and ClusterRoles. You can scope permissions to a specific namespace, ensuring the principle of least privilege.\nQuota Enforcement Namespaces allow administrators to apply resource quotas and limits, controlling how much CPU, memory, and objects (pods, PVCs, etc.) can be created.\nClean Organization Namespaced resources (like pods, services, and deployments) are logically grouped, making them easier to manage, monitor, and delete.\nUse Cases Separating Dev/Test/Prod environments within a single cluster Multi-team or multi-project Kubernetes deployments Scoped access for CI/CD pipelines Logical grouping of related applications and workloads Best Practices Use meaningful namespace names like payments-dev, search-prod, etc. Apply LimitRange and ResourceQuota to prevent resource hogging. Clean up unused namespaces to reduce clutter. Avoid putting everything in the default namespace. Use kubens and kubectx tools for easy namespace switching. Namespaces provide a powerful layer of logical separation in Kubernetes. When used properly, they enhance security, organization, and governance across teams and workloads.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Namespace A Kubernetes Namespace is a way to logically isolate …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/namespace/","tags":["kubernetes","multi-tenancy","rbac","isolation","namespaces"],"title":""},{"body":" Network Policy NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes defines rules for traffic flow at the IP level between pods and/or namespaces.

This minimizes the blast radius in case of a breach.\nZero Trust Architecture Enforces least privilege by only allowing explicitly permitted communications between workloads.\nSegmentation by Namespace or Label Policies can filter traffic based on pod selectors, namespaces, and even IP blocks — giving granular control over communication.\nWorks Across CNIs NetworkPolicy works with CNI plugins like Calico, Cilium, Weave, etc. (not all CNIs support them fully — be sure to check compatibility).\nUse Cases Allowing only frontend pods to talk to backend Blocking cross-namespace traffic Whitelisting access to a database pod Egress restrictions to prevent pods from accessing the internet Best Practices Label pods clearly to simplify NetworkPolicy creation. Always test policies in non-prod before rollout. Combine ingress and egress policies for full control. Start with a default deny-all policy and allow only what’s needed. Use a CNI that fully supports NetworkPolicy for enforcement. NetworkPolicies are your security perimeter inside the cluster. With careful design, you can build internal firewalls that restrict access just like in traditional networks.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Network Policy NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes defines rules for traffic …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/network_policy/","tags":["kubernetes","network","security","isolation","policy"],"title":""},{"body":" Persistent Volume A PersistentVolume (PV) in Kubernetes is a cluster-level storage resource that exists independent of pods. It represents actual storage — provisioned manually or dynamically — that can be mounted by pods via PersistentVolumeClaims.\nThink of it as a physical disk that can be lent out to workloads.\nTopics Benefits of PersistentVolumes Decouples Storage from Compute PV is a standalone resource — a pod can die or reschedule, but the volume (and its data) remains intact.\nSupports Multiple Backends PVs can come from various sources — EBS, NFS, Azure Disk, Google PD, CephFS, local disks, etc.\nFoundation for Stateful Workloads Without PVs, apps like databases, logs, and caches lose data on pod restart. PV makes stateful apps viable.\nDynamic or Static Provisioning Admins can pre-provision PVs (static) or use a StorageClass to create them on demand (dynamic).\nUse Cases Backing persistent databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) Storage for logs, artifacts, media Caching layers like Redis with persistence enabled Hosting user uploads or application state Best Practices Use ReadWriteOnce for most cases unless shared access is needed. Apply proper reclaimPolicy (e.g., Retain vs Delete). Tag PVs with labels to support matching. Monitor storage utilization and reclaim unused PVs. Use StorageClass for flexibility and dynamic scaling. PersistentVolumes bring durable storage to Kubernetes — making it suitable for production-grade applications that need to remember data.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Persistent Volume A PersistentVolume (PV) in Kubernetes is a …","ref":"/tictactech/blogs/kubernetes/persistent_volume/","tags":["kubernetes","storage","pv","volumes","persistent"],"title":""},{"body":" Persistent Volume Claim A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is how a pod requests storage from the Kubernetes cluster.

It represents a single instance of a running process, often wrapping one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network and storage context.\nMost of the time, a pod runs just one container (single-container pod), but you can run sidecars by adding multiple containers.\nTopics Benefits of Pods Unified Runtime Environment Containers in a pod share the same network namespace and volumes, making it easy to communicate over localhost and share data.\nAtomic Deployment The pod is deployed, scheduled, and managed as a single atomic unit. If one container fails, the pod as a whole can be restarted.\nFoundation for Controllers Pods are typically managed by higher-level objects like Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets — you rarely create standalone pods in production.\nUse Cases Running a single containerized application Sidecar pattern (e.g., app + logging container) Short-lived jobs and batch processing Infrastructure services (like CoreDNS) Best Practices Never treat pods as permanent — they’re ephemeral. Use Deployments/ReplicaSets to manage pods automatically. Define readiness and liveness probes for better lifecycle management. Use labels to group and select pods efficiently. Avoid storing state in pods; use volumes or external stores. Pods are where containers live and breathe in Kubernetes.
